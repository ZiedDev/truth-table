# truth-table

we added support for all the 7 gates which includes

- and
- or
- xor
- nand
- nor
- xnor
- not

As well as added ways to type some gates to simplify writing the expression
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>and</td>
        <td>&</td>
        <td>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>or</td>
        <td>|</td>
        <td>+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>xor</td>
        <td>^</td>
        <td>âŠ•</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>not</td>
        <td>!</td>
        <td>~</td>
    </tr>
</table>
